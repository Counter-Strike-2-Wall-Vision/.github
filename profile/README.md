# üëÅÔ∏è Counter-Strike 2 Wall Vision

The **Counter-Strike 2 Wall Vision** overlay is a legitimate **vision-training and spatial-awareness utility** built for aim-map practice, demo review, and coaching.
It draws line-of-sight outlines and positional cues based on replay or local telemetry so you can study how players see and move through each map ‚Äî *without modifying gameplay or providing hidden enemy data*.

Think of it as an analytical overlay for understanding sightlines, timing, and cover usage ‚Äî perfect for tactical refinement or VOD breakdowns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

Unlike prohibited wall-through vision cheats, this **Wall Vision Tool** relies only on positional and replay data available through Valve‚Äôs demo API. It visualizes **field-of-view cones, occlusion maps, and visibility grids**, helping players and teams learn how to use angles, cover, and movement effectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool is **for demo review, offline practice, and coaching**. It does **not** inject into live matches or reveal hidden opponents.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q1: Is this VAC-safe?**
