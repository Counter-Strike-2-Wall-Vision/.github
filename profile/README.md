# 👁️ Counter-Strike 2 Wall Vision

The **Counter-Strike 2 Wall Vision** overlay is a legitimate **vision-training and spatial-awareness utility** built for aim-map practice, demo review, and coaching.
It draws line-of-sight outlines and positional cues based on replay or local telemetry so you can study how players see and move through each map — *without modifying gameplay or providing hidden enemy data*.

Think of it as an analytical overlay for understanding sightlines, timing, and cover usage — perfect for tactical refinement or VOD breakdowns.

## ⚙️ Overview

Unlike prohibited wall-through vision cheats, this **Wall Vision Tool** relies only on positional and replay data available through Valve’s demo API. It visualizes **field-of-view cones, occlusion maps, and visibility grids**, helping players and teams learn how to use angles, cover, and movement effectively.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool is **for demo review, offline practice, and coaching**. It does **not** inject into live matches or reveal hidden opponents.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q1: Is this VAC-safe?**
✅ Yes. It runs externally and uses demo/telemetry data only.

**Q2: Can it be used in competitive matches?**
❌ No. It’s a review and training utility, not a live-match aid.

**Q3: Does it show enemy positions behind walls?**
Only if that information exists in a **demo file** for analysis — never in live games.

**Q4: Does it affect FPS?**
Negligible (<3 %), as it renders separately from the Source 2 engine.

**Q5: Can I export visuals?**
Yes — screenshots and heatmaps can be exported via the *Export* tab.
